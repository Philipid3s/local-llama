# bonsAI - local ollama client

A lightweight, private, and powerful web interface for your local Ollama models. Chat with your favorite AI models, analyze PDF documents with OCR support, and ground responses with real-time web search from a clean, responsive UI.

## Features

### Core Chat Experience
- **Full Model Support**: Seamlessly switch between any models pulled to your local Ollama instance.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Experience token-by-token response generation for a fluid chat experience.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Beautifully rendered responses including code blocks (with syntax highlighting), lists, tables, and links.
- **Thread Management**: Organize conversations into multiple threads with the ability to rename and delete.
- **Local Persistence**: All chat history and document context are stored in your browser's `localStorage` for privacy and speed.

### Document Intelligence (RAG-lite)
- **PDF Context**: Attach multiple PDF files to any thread. The application extracts text and injects it as context for the model.
- **OCR Fallback**: Built-in OCR support using `Tesseract.js`. If a PDF is scanned or image-heavy, the system automatically falls back to OCR so the AI can read the content.
- **Smart Truncation**: Automatically manages large documents to fit within model context limits while preserving relevant information.

### Web-Search Grounding
- **Brave Search Integration**: Toggle "Web Search" to provide the model with up-to-date information from the internet.
- **Intent Detection**: The system intelligently decides when to search based on your prompt, such as requests for the latest news or current weather.
- **Source Citation**: Encourages the model to cite sources and URLs from the retrieved search results.
